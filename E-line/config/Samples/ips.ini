// Sample ips.ini file
// The ips.ini will determine which ips have access to reserved slots.
// IP stands for Internet Protocol.  IP addresses are a series
// of 4 numbers, with each number in the range 0 to 255.
// If you do not know your IP address, you can get it by running
// (Start >> Run >> winipcfg) in Windows 9x.
// For windows2000/NT users, run a command line interface (CLI)
// (Start >> Run >> Cmd) and enter "ipconfig" at the command prompt.
// For Linux type hostname -i at your commandline or type ifconfig.

//Single IP numbers can be entered as follows (no port numbers are required):

129.49.231.126
172.54.512.7

//If you use subnets (common in Ethernet Local Area Networks) you can specify
//your subnet mask (kind of like and IP inside an IP)

129.49.231.126/255.255.255.0

//To cover all IPs between 168.23.21.0 and 168.23.21.255, simply set the last
//digit to 0

168.23.21.0

//To cover all IPs starting with 168.23, simply add:

168.23.0.0
