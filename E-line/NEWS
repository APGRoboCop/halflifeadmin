    Changes/Additions:

     * Reserved nicknames, reserved slots and private servers work correctly
       with Steam servers. This means full Steam support now.
     * Fixed the problem of admins losing access rights upon mapchange.
     * The plugin_info() function is no longer triggered in plugins before the
       plugin_connect() function is called for a connecting player.
     * Added support for #include directive to .ini config files which will 
       include another config file. The filename must be enclosed in double 
       quotes ("") or angular brackets (<>). When using #include "file" the 
       file is searched relative to the directory that the including file is in. 
       When using #include <file> the file is searched relative to the MOD 
       directory (e.g.  cstrike). The former version is probably easier for
       most users.
     * Added support for loading plugins from a directory either by specifying a
       directory name in the plugins.ini file or by using a directory name in
       admin_plugin_file. All files that end in .amx are loaded from the
       directory in alphabetical order. To prevent a file from loading, simply
       add .noload to the end of the filename.
     * A PostgreSQL version of Admin Mod is now available, donated by Idy and
       AKP.
     * Allow for no plugins being loaded. A warning will still be written to the
       logs in case this wasn't what the admin intended.
     * Added admin_cmd as a shorter version of admin_command. Both can be used.
     * Made admin_version directly accessible from the server console.
     * CS timelimit reporting is now accurate under Windows, too, for CS 1.6.
       This does not work with CS 1.5, where timelimit may still be off under
       Windows.
     * Changed selfmessage() message buffer size to LARGE_BUF_SIZE.
     * Reformatted userlist() output, added access right and immunity status.
     * Changed plugin_CS to work with CS 1.6. Weapon restriction function has
       been changed considerably. Settings can be made permanent from the
       console, admin_restrict can be used with weapon names.


    New CVARS:

     * Read-only cvar ami_sv_maxplayers: contains the server's original
       maxplayers value. Can be used by third party server browsers.
     * PostgreSQL version:
       pgsql_database
       pgsql_dbtable_ips
       pgsql_dbtable_models
       pgsql_dbtable_plugins
       pgsql_dbtable_users
       pgsql_dbtable_tags
       pgsql_dbtable_words
       pgsql_host
       pgsql_port
       pgsql_pass
       pgsql_user
       pgsql_preload 
       pgsql_users_sql
       pgsql_tags_sql
       The pgsql_port cvar specifyies the port of the PostgreSQL server. For a
       local server using Unix Domain Sockets instead of TCP/IP the local UDS
       file is used, e.g. pgsql ".s.PGSQL.5432" with pgsql_host "/tmp". All
       other cvars work like their MySQL counterparts.


    Bug Fixes:
    
     * Fixed admin_tsay and admin_csay commands so that say text doesn't have to
       be enclosed in quotes.
     * Another fix to the strbreak() scripting function.
     * Fixed docpath and Specify() bugs in Win32 installer.
     * Do not run plugin_info() for a kicked player.
     * Fixed bug with CS timelimit not working correctly with Linux server.
     * Fixed Linux version of Small compiler to handle DOS files and work when
       no PWD envvar is set.
     * Fixed exploit which would allow players to switch their name to a
       reserved IP and gain access rights associated with that IP.
     * Fixed free/reserved slot reporting to be more robust. 
     * Fixed exploit in plugin_antiflood.
     * Have "" be accepted as "undefined" in adminmod.cfg for all file and
       string cvars.
     * Fixed reject and kick messages to work with old and new clients.


    Coding:

     * VerifyUserAuth() gets called in any case in AddUserAuth(), no matter if
       mapchange, reconnect or new connet.
     * INFO_KEYVAL_SIZE replaces BUF_SIZE for get_/set_serverinfo().
     * Removed HAS_SNPRINTF macros. Everybody has snprintf().
     * Changed the semnatics of auth_struct::head() to return the *current*
       head. Get the next head position with get_head() instead.
     * Changed IsComment() to is_comment(). Overloaded to check for // instead
       for /.
     * Added various utility functions to check and get a cvar value for cvars
       holding string values or filenames/paths: cvar_string_value_is_set(),
       cvar_string_is_set(), cvar_file_value_is_set(), cvar_file_is_set()
       get_cvar_string_value(), get_cvar_file_value(). 
     * Added filesystem node abstraction AmFSNode and AmDir.
