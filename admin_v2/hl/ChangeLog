02.06.2001:
	I start my summing up all changes since the admin-1_50-release CVS
	tag:

	CLinkList.cpp:
	CLinkList.h:
	--------------
	The linked list and list item classes have been converted to
	templates. This is necessary because we can't use a void* pointer
	to store data in the items. Using a void* pointer will cause a
	memory link since the destructor of an object stored will not be
	called. The template declaration includes an argument to specify
	if the list item object will be used to store a single element or
	an array of elements. This is necessary to call the correct delete
	operator on destruction. All other files have been adapted to use
	the templates. I removed some C-type casts which are unnecessary
	when using the templates. We should gradually change to C++-type
	casts if they are necessary.

	The insertion was fixed which fixes a bug of registered commands
	not showing up in admin_help.
	

	CPlugin.h:
	CPlugin.cpp:
	------------
	Jag added a simple log line handle to parse log lines in
	plugins. It is of experimental nature and only available in the
	non-MM version.


	Makefile:
	---------
	Well, just a little cleanup, removing the double (and wrong)
	optimization flags. Removed linkfunc.ccp from the MM build.
	The real changes will come with the 2.51 branch merge. (OMG)


	admin_commands.cpp:
	-------------------
	The wrong time bug in ban() has been fixed.

	Log string size has been increased to LARGE_BUF_SIZE.

	Added debug message to plugin_register*() functions.

	tsay(), centersay() and rainbow() messages get logged in the logs with
	newlines replaced with "\n" strings.

	vote_multiple() function diplays all options, not only the last
	one.

	Added const_casts on STRING() calls in order to use the original
	HLSDK STRING() function and get rid of those compiler warnings.

	Jag moved the contents of the getteamcount() function around. =)

	Added slay() function which is independant from the setting of
	allow_execclient.

	Added more bot protections if admin_bot_protection is on. It
	should work now also if admin_fx is turned on.

	Fixed gettarget() and pointto() crashes under Linux. The Linux
	version of CS and TFC don't like the HLSDK EyePosition() function.


	admin_mod.cpp:
	--------------

	Cvars added: admin_repeat_freq, admin_parse_logs (only non-MM),
	admin_vote_echo, amv_autoban. Other CVars have changed default
	settings: admin_connect_msg, admin_repeat_msg.

	AM_ClientConnect(): Setting some structures to 0 seems to have
	fixed that mysterious crash when compiling optimized.

	Check for player names with non-printable characters. They are
	denied access. If they change name in midgame, their HL is closed
	on the client machine and a 24h ban issued depending on the
	setting of amv_autoban.

	Metamod stuff changed to match new interface version.

	Added MM function GetEngineFunctions_Post()

	Changed DispatchObjectCollsionBox() to hide the timer entity.


	extdll.h:
	---------
	Fixed MSVC cimpiling problems whem compiling in DENUG mode and
	added #pragma warning(disable : 4018) to hide the signed/unsigned
	mismatch warnings.

	Adapted to use the original STRING() function and updated
	functions UTIL_LogPrintfFNL() and make_friendly().


	hexport.cpp:
	------------
	Catches engine fuctions to hide the timer entity. This removed the
	crashes in TFC.


	make_pass:
	----------
	Updated to better make use of the new encryption scheme, improving
	usability. Hmmm, I thought this was added already before.


	MSVC schtuff:
	-------------
	Oh well, updated the workspace files to work. Added resource file
	adminmod.rc which adds a version information to the Windows dll.


	timer.h:
	timer.cpp:
	----------
	Added MaxVoteChoice member and access functions. Updated the
	StartVote() function to use ChoiceCount. Not sure what it does.


	users.cpp:
	----------
	Removed '*' from the list of comment characters.

	MySQL fixes from Jon Paul Nollmann.

	HandleLog() function for the log parsing (non-MM only).
	
	Most changes are to use the new templates.

	users.h:
	--------
	Added DEBUG_LOG and DEVEL_LOG macros to make it easier to log
	debug messages.


	util.cpp:
	---------
	Changed make_friendly() to check for non.printable characters. The
	check is optional and can be enabled with the second 

	Added UTIL_LogPrintfFNL() function which acts like
	UTIL_LogPrintf() but converts newlines within the string to "\n"
	literals, if there is enough space in the array, else they are
	replaced with blanks.

	UTIL_LogPrintf() uses vsnprintf() instead of vnprintf() to prevent
	buffer overflow.

	CLIENT_PRINTF() replaced with SystemResponse(), fixing crash when
	the player lookup function found more than one match on a partial
	name. 

	
03.06.2001:
	Added the string tables to the dll. execclient() checks now if the
	command is a valid command. 

	Bot protections have been extended to more functions, among which
	are message() and messageex(). 

	Added the amutil.h file officially to the project. As of now it
	has the DEBUG_LOG and DEVEL_LOG macros. They use direct values of
	the respective cvars to speed things up, saving a string
	comparison. All debug messages in admin_commands.cpp have been
	replaced by DEBUG_LOG. 

	Other cvars with direct access are amv_autoban and
	admin_bot_protection. They are registered and their pointers set
	in h_export.cpp::GiveFnptrsToDll(). 

	writefile() didn't create a new file unless the "append"
	parameters was provided. This has been fixed.


10.06.2001:
	Added some commands to execclient list so that CS chooseteam
	works. 

	Moved IsPlayerValid() to extdll.h to make it inline.

	Added IsPlayerValid() checks to lots of admin_commands.cpp
	commands to protect against referencing Null pointers.


16.06.2001:
	CPlugin.cpp: Added system error reports to CPlugin::LoadFile()
	function.

	Changed things a bit in the Makefile to make it more easy to set
	the new version number and to switch to the MySQL build.


	admin_commands.cpp: 
	------------------- 
	Added the plugin_exec() function.  Fixed the bot_protection in
	teleport() not showing special fx.


	Added #pragma pack() to the end of amx.h to stop the
	packing. Tried to move include directives so that amx.h always
	gets included last. This enabled MySQL support under Windows.


	extdll.h:
	---------
	The version number now comes from the Makefile. Added mysql tag to
	the version information.


	Removed the log parsing from the MM-built.

	Some replacements with DEBUG_LOG().

	Fixed a bug in timer.cpp::IsValidTimer() checking for the wrong
	constant.

	
	util.cpp:
	---------
	Fixed a bug in the bad name detection. make_friendly replaces %
	now with spaces instead of deleting them.

	Fixed a bug in the logging functions of centersay et al which
	messed up the formatting.


18.06.2001:
	Added some AHL and S&I client commands.

	Reenabled playerinfo() for bots.
