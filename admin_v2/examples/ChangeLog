26.05.2001:
	-- admin_map stores the mp_timelimit. This is useful for people
	who don't have mp_timelimit set in their server.cfg.

28.05.2001:
	Added KillGlow() function to turn off glow when admin_fun is set
	to 0.

02.06.2001:
	I try to sum up all changes since the 2.50 release here:

	Fixed various typos.

	plugin_CS:
	----------

	The restrict message is lowercase to make it narrower.

	plugin_TFC:
	-----------

	Fixed a bug using admin_tfc_balance instead of the correct cvar
	name admin_balance_teams.

	plugin_base:
	------------

	admin_hostname uses the whole name, not only the first word.

	admin_map and admin_vote_map store the mp_timelimit before they
	set it to 1. It is restored after the mapchange.

	admin_pass will echo the current password if none is supplied.

	admin_vsay checks if a vote is allowed.

	plugin_hlds_mapvote:
	--------------------

	ACCESS_CONTROL_VOTE replaces ACCESS_ALL for admin_cancelvote,
	admin_denyvote and admin_startvote. 

	Fixed an echoing message and the extend vote

	plugin_message:
	---------------

	Setting admin_connect_msg to "0" will not display a connect
	message, although the timer is run.

	Setting admin_repeat_msg to "0" will not display a repeat message
	but the timer is not killed if it was started. It will continue to
	run and setting admin_repeat_msg to a different value will again
	display that string.

	The repeat message frequqency can be set with
	admin_repeat_freq. The units are seconds. The minimum value is 15
	seconds. Setting it to 0 will not start the timer. The timer
	cannot be started by setting it to a different value during a
	map. It will only be started at a mapchange.

	plugin_retribution:
	-------------------

	admin_slay uses the new slay() function and is thus independant
	from the setting of allow_execclient. It will only issue the
	message and the thunderclap noise if the target was really
	slayn. It respects admin_quiet.

	The same is true for admin_slay_team.


	admin.inc:
	----------

	Added rainbow() function.
	Added slay() function.
	
	Overriding admin_quiet will not print the admins name.


08.06.2001:
	Moved access level for _execclient, _execall and _execteam to
	65536. 

	Increased pause between easteregg triggers to eight minutes to
	make it less annoying.


16.06.2001:
	Updated the compilation .bat files to match the ones from the
	release so that they work under Win95. They have been adjusted to
	the local directory structure.

	Make the mp_timelimit storing in plugin_base more efficient. Well,
	I'm not even sure it worked before.

	Added the plugin_exec() native function definition to admin.inc

18.06.2001:
	Updated admin_messagemode to use the plugin_exec() function on
	admin_* commands.
