Admin Mod FAQ



                                     FAQ

     ------------------------------------------------------------------



    How can I get it working in tfc,firearms,goldeneye,... ?
      1. Copy cstrike/dlls/admin.dll (and admin_i386.so) to <mod dir>/dlls
      2. Edit the <mod dir>/liblist.gam so the game dll lines are
         changed thus:

         gamedll "dlls\admin.dll"
         gamedll_linux "dlls/admin_i386.so"

    It isn't working!
    Okay, before sending me anything go through these steps.

      1. Read the webpages
      2. Do step 1 again
      3. If the game loads, type "admin_help" into the console and see
         what it says
      4. If it doesn't load, get a log of why it isn't
      5. to turn logging on add the line "log on" to valve/autoexec.cfg
      6. If you must send email, make sure you send logs of the
         problem,a copy of you users.ini,nicks.ini, server.cfg and any
         other related file. Also tell me which OS you are using
         (win95,98,linux...).

    How do I set my password to access admin commands?
    type "setinfo pw-admin password" where password is your password.
    The same goes for setting your nick password.



    Why won't my passwords work in win32?
    Because win32 uses unencrypted passwords in the users and nicks file
    (i.e you don't need to use make_pass, just type the password in the
    file).



    Why don't password work in freebsd?
    Ok, this is possible, but normally superfluous, as FreeBSD has perl
    builtin. But anyhow, I tried and it worked:

    1.) Get the perl-RPM from the RedHat 5.2 Distro (as FreeBSD
    Linux-Compat bases on that distro). I used the perl-RPM from the
    Linux-Mandrake 5.3 Distro (which was a very close clone to RedHat
    5.2 at that time), it is called perl-5.004m4-1.i386.rpm (I guest it
    is the same as the RH 5.2 one)

    2.) Install it via rpm, as preventive measure call rpm via
    /compat/linux/bin/rpm as there is a rpm proggy in /usr/local/bin of
    FreeBSD and I don't know what happens if that is run:
    /compat/linux/bin/rpm -Uvh perl-5.004m4-1.i386.rpm

    3.) Call make pass: /compat/linux/usr/bin/perl makepass name pass
    You also can change the first line of make_pass script to include
    the proper perl call, then you can call ./make_pass name pass.

    It is important that perl is called from the /compat/linux dirtree,
    otherwise the FreeBSD-perl is used which produces the wrong output.
    Also, rpm should be called from /compat/linux as well, as the
    /usr/local/bin/rpm my not install the rpm in the /compat/linux tree,
    thus overwriting the freebsd-perl installation.

    (Thanks go to Dominik for providing the answer)



    Why won't my nick password work under win95?
    Its a bug :) Upgrade to 0.75 or above



    Why does my server start up, then crash straight away?
    This is usally because it is trying to load the wrong dll. Firstly,
    try deleting ANY admin.ini files anywhere in your halflife directory
    structure. If this doesn't fix it, put an "admin.ini" file in the
    mods directory and put the mods dll name (i.e dlls\cs.dll) in it
    (.so for linux, .dll for win32)



    Where can I get more help?
    I suggest throwing your questions up on as forum first because some
    of the times, your question has already been asked and maybe even
    answered. I usually read the www.counter-strike.net Server Op forum
    a lot. Hey, I might even respond to your post there. If you get no
    help there then email Alfred.



    How does reserved slots work?
    It will only let maxplayers-reserve_slots onto the server, unless
    the person connecting is a valid user and has the reserved flag
    (32768). This person should then have admin_kick access so they can
    clean up the server if they want.
