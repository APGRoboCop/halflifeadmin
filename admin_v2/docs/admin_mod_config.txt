                       Intro
                       Configuring Half-Life Admin Mod isn't difficult nor teadious, it
                       just requires some understanding of whats going on. It actually
                       should take you less than ten minutes to get it up and running after
                       you read this. I will address each file you need to configure
                       seperately. Hopefully this will ease up on the confusion. First, put
                       ALL config files you create in the same directory as the mod you are
                       playing admin mod with (i.e cstrike/ for counter-strike). Heres a
                       quick description of what each of the admin mod files are for:



                              users.ini
                                         The users.ini file is used to specify who
                                         will have special rights on your server (by
                                         name) and what commands do they have
                                         permissions to use.



                              nicks.ini
                                         The nicks.ini file is basically used for
                                         name reservation. It prevents players from
                                         using the specified names unless they set
                                         the correct password. It makes sense to add
                                         all the player names that are in the
                                         users.ini to this file also. It's  like
                                         added protection. Just make sure that you
                                         set the same password for the corresponding
                                         name or problems will arise.



                              ips.ini
                                         The ips.ini file is used for slot
                                         reservation on your server based on ip
                                         address. All you have to do is specify the
                                         ip's of the people that can use one of your
                                         reserved slots.



                              models.ini
                                         The models.ini file is basically used for
                                         model reservation. It prevents players from
                                         using the specified model unless they set
                                         the correct password. It lets you protect
                                         your clans model from other unauthorised
                                         players using it.



                              maps.ini
                                         The maps.ini file is used to control which
                                         maps users can vote for. It has the same
                                         format at the mapcycle.txt file.

                       There is also an admin.ini file but it is usually not needed (read,
                       DON'T have it)
                       If you are using a non-supported mod or auto detection fails, email

    [ sample ]
    Here is a list of what variables go in your server.cfg and what they do:
    The easiest way to edit your server.cfg is to just copy the text from this sample server.cfg and just
    change the values.

    Notes
     - If vote_freq is not defined voting will be disabled.
     - If map_ratio is not defined map voting is disabled.
     - If kick_ratio is not defined kicking will be disabled.
     - If models_file is not defined model passwording will be disabled.
     - If nicks_file is not defined nick reservation will be disabled.
     - If maps_file is not defined then users can vote for any map inthe mapcycle.txt file.



  users.ini
  [ sample ]
  The users.ini file is where you will store all of the player names, passwords, and access levels of the
  players that you want to have privileges on your server. The format of the users.ini like this:
                                             username:password:access

  Where:
   - username : is just the players name exactly how it is when they play the game. If you want to use a
  colon(":") in the players name then backslash it, like this. [CLA]\:Jodie, this will add user [CLA]:Jodie.
   - password : is the password you want the client to have. For Win32 passwords are plain text (i.e. butthead)
  and for linux, passwords need to be crypted using make_pass included with the tgz file.
   - access : is just the number  you get when you add up all the numbers that correspond to the commands that
  you want to give this user. (see sample users.ini for examples)

                   access                            commands that can be used
                all players    admin_help,admin_userlist,admin_version,admin_timeleft

                     4         admin_prematch,admin_reload
                     8         admin_pause,admin_unpause
                     16        admin_pass,admin_nopass
                     32        admin_teamplay,admin_friendlyfire
                     64        admin_say
                    128        admin_kick
                    256        admin_ban,admin_unban

                    8192
                   16384
                   32768       let this user use a reserve spot





  nicks.ini
  [ sample ]
  The nicks.ini file is simple, all you have to put in it is a list of players and passwords of those who don't
  want others using their names. The basic concept is "I password protected my name". Thats all, its not that
  hard. Here is the format of the nicks.ini:
                                                 username:password

  Where username and password are the same as in the users.ini.

  It is a good idea to reserve nicks for all players that are in the users.ini, it just prevents confusion.



 ips.ini
 [ sample ]
 The ips.ini file is very simple also, it just specifies what ip addresses have access to take up one of the
 reserved slots. IP address are define in the IP_ADDRESS/NETMASK format (i.e 192.168.1.0/255.255.255.0 to match
 192.168.1.0-255)



   models.ini                                                                                                  [
   sample ]
   The models.ini file is simple, all you have to put in it is a list of models and passwords of those who don't
   want others using their models. The basic concept is "I password protected my model". Thats all, its not that
   hard. Here is the format of the models.ini:
                                                model_name:password

   Where model_name is the name of the model to protect (i.e "sas" ) and password is the password to protect
   that model (same as users.ini).

   You can use this function to reserve your clans models only for use by clan members on your server.



    maps.ini                                                                                                  [
    sample ]
    This file contains a list of maps that players are allowed to vote for. Here is the format of the maps.ini:
                                                     map_name

    Where map_name is the name of the map which users can vote for with admin_vote_maps (i.e "2fort" )

    You can use this function to restrict which maps users can vote for on your server. This is so you can have
    special maps which cannot be accessed through voting.



                       make_pass  [ Linux Only ]
                       For all you penguins...

                       make_pass is just a perl script that uses libcrypt to generate
                       encrypted passwords. If you are using linux then I shouldn't even
                       explain to you how to use it, but I will just in case you're new to
                       it or something like that. Here is the format of the make_pass
                       command:

                                       make_pass [-n] <username> <password>

                       Where:
                        - -n : with this flag the output is read to be pasted into any of
                       the ini files
                        - <username> : is the players name when they are playing the game
                        - <password> : is the desired password in plain text

                       For example, if I want a user name Jodie with password bob, this is
                       how I do it. Cd in to your hlds_l directory then type: make_pass
                       Jodie bob at prompt. It should output jog2guNs5Pi3w. so there is
                       your password, just use that in the users.ini and the nicks.ini.
                       Just remember that the client still has to type in the plain text
                       password, not the encrypted one.
