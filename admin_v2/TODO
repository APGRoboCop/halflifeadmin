put info about adding clan tag protection in FAQ
make the docs obvious about how setinfo works
models not reporting right? (http://www.cfgn.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?postid=27824#post27824)


ISSUES TO DOUBLE CHECK OR GET MORE DATA:
vote overflow message  http://www.cfgn.net/vbulletin/showthread.php?postid=53146#post53146  (new timer system should fix it ...)
large names not being recognised? (could not repeat problem)
public_slots misreporting before the first client connects (is this a problem?, also should be fixed now)
multiple matches cause a kick? (couldn't replicate for users.ini, will happen in MYSQL)
ping kick not working? (couldn't replicate. Wait for more reports I spose)



WISH LIST ITEMS:
let ini files be got via http (this ain't as easy as it sounds)
tk stuff (via usermsg.cpp idea)
reserving for spectators
gui config tool  (karel is doing this)
band via ip addr
centersay() location option
make swear word detect replace swear words (i.e f*ck with love ...)
