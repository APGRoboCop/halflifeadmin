Compiling
_____________

Requirements:

halflife sdk installed.

To compile this mod you have to add the following lines to
engine/eiface.h:


---------
        int                     (*pfnIsDedicatedServer)
(void);// is this a dedicated server?
+       cvar_t          (*pfnCVarGetPointer)            (const
char *szVarName);
+       unsigned int    (*pfnGetPlayerWONId)
(edict_t *e);
} enginefuncs_t;
// be sure to bump INTERFACE_VERSION if you add a new function
---------

(care of leon hartwig, the MAN!)

Win32: just open the mp.dsw file and compile it. Trust me, you know more
about how win32 does its thng than I do. If anyone wants to make a proper
project, I will add it :)

Linux: just type "make".
