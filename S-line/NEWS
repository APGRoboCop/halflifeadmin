22.08.2004 2.50.60

    Changes/Additions:

     * Added a 64bit Linux version for AMD64. The 64bit version uses 64bit script
       binaries which are not compatible with 32bit script binaries. They have
       the file extension .amx64. To compile for Linux 64bit, a new compiler is
       used: sc64. The compile and compile_all scripts have optional -32 and -64
       switches to explicitely choose the compiler (for cross-compiling).
     * Revised Windows installer install_admin.vbs to properly detect new Steam
       accounts and have a more consistent user interface. Works with CS:CZ
       Retail version. A missing listenserver.cfg is now automatically created by
       the installer.
       The uninstaller has been updated accordingly.
     * Added cvar_exists() scripting function to check if a cvar exists or not.
       The function returns 1 if a cvar exists, 0 if not. (Patch 908067 by Kevin
       Masterson.
     * Added get_timer() scripting function. It returns a value describing the 
       status of the timer index passed in.
     * Added valid_mapex() scripting function. It allows the valid map check to 
       bypass the map.ini check and just check for the existance of the map.
     * Admin Mod is now unloadable at any time. It is still only loadable on
       server start, though. 
     * Allow the use of the loopback IP 127.0.0.1 in the users.ini file. Improves
       listenserver support.
     * Added format directives 'l' and 'h' for snprintf() to specify long or
       short values. Useful on AMD64 systems. See a Linux man page or MSDN help 
       page for a description.
     * Revised plugin_CS:
       + Added possibility to delete previously saved map and server default 
         restrictions. Command-syntax is admin_restrict delete map/default 
       + Added console/screenmessage when saving/deleting default restrictions.  
         Before you couldn't see that anything happened at all.  
       + Added a submenu to the restrictionmenu "Restrictions defaults" wich can 
         save, delete and apply the map and server default restrictions.  
       + Fixed a bug where admin_restrict listed the longer list of items/weapons 
         (restricted or available) instead of the shorter one.  
       + Improved version detection, using the new cvar_exists() function.
       + Implemented team- and playerspecific restrictions.


    New CVARs:

     * mysql_port to set the port of the MySQL server if it differs from
       the default port. (Patch #888683, by Indan Zupancic)


    Bug Fixes:

     * Fixed some issues in listenserver user detection.
     * Fixed an exploit in admin_passwd.
     * Fixed an exploit on servers with amv_private_server set. Users could join
       a server under their registered name and then change their nickname to an
       unregistered name without getting kicked.
     * Fixed rare crashes due to NULL pointer access when starting plugins.
     * Fixed the server crashing instead of exiting cleanly when Admin Mod calls
       exit during startup, e.g. because the scripting engine could not be loaded.


    Coding:

     * Fixed issue with differing crypt() prototypes (crypt.h) on different Linux
       systems.
     * Compiles cleanly with gcc3 now.
