22.08.2004 2.50.60

    Changes/Additions:

     * Added a 64bit Linux version for AMD64. The 64bit version uses 64bit script
       binaries which are not compatible with 32bit script binaries. They have
       the file extension .amx64. To compile for Linux 64bit, a new compiler is
       used: sc64. The compile and compile_all scripts have optional -32 and -64
       switches to explicitely choose the compiler (for cross-compiling).
     * Revised Windows installer install_admin.vbs to properly detect new Steam
       accounts and have a more consistent user interface. Works with CS:CZ
       Retail version. A missing listenserver.cfg is now automatically created by
       the installer.
       The uninstaller has been updated accordingly.
     * Added cvar_exists() scripting function to check if a cvar exists or not.
       The function returns 1 if a cvar exists, 0 if not. (Patch 908067 by Kevin
       Masterson.
     * Added get_timer() scripting function. It returns a value describing the 
       status of the timer index passed in.
     * Added valid_mapex() scripting function. It allows the valid map check to 
       bypass the map.ini check and just check for the existance of the map.
     * Admin Mod is now unloadable at any time. It is still only loadable on
       server start, though. 
     * Allow the use of the loopback IP 127.0.0.1 in the users.ini file. Improves
       listenserver support.
     * Added format directives 'l' and 'h' for snprintf() to specify long or
       short values. Useful on AMD64 systems. See a Linux man page or MSDN help 
       page for a description.
     * Revised plugin_CS:
       + Added possibility to delete previously saved map and server default 
         restrictions. Command-syntax is admin_restrict delete map/default 
       + Added console/screenmessage when saving/deleting default restrictions.  
         Before you couldn't see that anything happened at all.  
       + Added a submenu to the restrictionmenu "Restrictions defaults" wich can 
         save, delete and apply the map and server default restrictions.  
       + Fixed a bug where admin_restrict listed the longer list of items/weapons 
         (restricted or available) instead of the shorter one.  
       + Improved version detection, using the new cvar_exists() function.
       + Implemented team- and playerspecific restrictions.


    New CVARs:

     * mysql_port to set the port of the MySQL server if it differs from
       the default port. (Patch #888683, by Indan Zupancic)


    Bug Fixes:

     * Fixed some issues in listenserver user detection.
     * Fixed an exploit in admin_passwd.
     * Fixed an exploit on servers with amv_private_server set. Users could join
       a server under their registered name and then change their nickname to an
       unregistered name without getting kicked.
     * Fixed rare crashes due to NULL pointer access when starting plugins.
     * Fixed the server crashing instead of exiting cleanly when Admin Mod calls
       exit during startup, e.g. because the scripting engine could not be loaded.


    Coding:

     * Fixed issue with differing crypt() prototypes (crypt.h) on different Linux
       systems.
     * Compiles cleanly with gcc3 now.




04.01.2004 2.50.59

    Changes/Additions:

     * Added motd() scripting function to display a message of the day window.
     * Added admin_motd command to plugin_base.
     * Users starting a Windows listenserver will automatically be authenticated
       and do not need to provide a password anymore. Access levels for reserved
       slot and reserved nickname are granted by default. All other access 
       levels depend on an entry in the users.ini file.   
     

    Bug Fixes:

     * Revised version of plugin_CS.
     * Fixed dll version checking for Linux installer on systems without 'ident'
       and 'strings'.
     * Make free slots reporting recognise changes to reserve_type.
     * Fixed kicks not getting executed correctly.


    Coding:

     * Linux Makefile automatically makes and includes object dependencies.
     * Compilation against 111x engine interface version possible by using
       EIV and having a corresponding directory setup.




05.10.2003 2.50.58

    Changes/Additions:

     * Reserved nicknames, reserved slots and private servers work correctly
       with Steam servers. This means full Steam support now.
     * Fixed the problem of admins losing access rights upon mapchange.
     * The plugin_info() function is no longer triggered in plugins before the
       plugin_connect() function is called for a connecting player.
     * Added support for #include directive to .ini config files which will 
       include another config file. The filename must be enclosed in double 
       quotes ("") or angular brackets (<>). When using #include "file" the 
       file is searched relative to the directory that the including file is in. 
       When using #include <file> the file is searched relative to the MOD 
       directory (e.g.  cstrike). The former version is probably easier for
       most users.
     * Added support for loading plugins from a directory either by specifying a
       directory name in the plugins.ini file or by using a directory name in
       admin_plugin_file. All files that end in .amx are loaded from the
       directory in alphabetical order. To prevent a file from loading, simply
       add .noload to the end of the filename.
     * A PostgreSQL version of Admin Mod is now available, donated by Idy and
       AKP.
     * Allow for no plugins being loaded. A warning will still be written to the
       logs in case this wasn't what the admin intended.
     * Added admin_cmd as a shorter version of admin_command. Both can be used.
     * Made admin_version directly accessible from the server console.
     * CS timelimit reporting is now accurate under Windows, too, for CS 1.6.
       This does not work with CS 1.5, where timelimit may still be off under
       Windows.
     * Changed selfmessage() message buffer size to LARGE_BUF_SIZE.
     * Reformatted userlist() output, added access right and immunity status.
     * Changed plugin_CS to work with CS 1.6. Weapon restriction function has
       been changed considerably. Settings can be made permanent from the
       console, admin_restrict can be used with weapon names.


    New CVARS:

     * Read-only cvar ami_sv_maxplayers: contains the server's original
       maxplayers value. Can be used by third party server browsers.
     * PostgreSQL version:
       pgsql_database
       pgsql_dbtable_ips
       pgsql_dbtable_models
       pgsql_dbtable_plugins
       pgsql_dbtable_users
       pgsql_dbtable_tags
       pgsql_dbtable_words
       pgsql_host
       pgsql_port
       pgsql_pass
       pgsql_user
       pgsql_preload 
       pgsql_users_sql
       pgsql_tags_sql
       The pgsql_port cvar specifyies the port of the PostgreSQL server. For a
       local server using Unix Domain Sockets instead of TCP/IP the local UDS
       file is used, e.g. pgsql ".s.PGSQL.5432" with pgsql_host "/tmp". All
       other cvars work like their MySQL counterparts.


    Bug Fixes:
    
     * Fixed admin_tsay and admin_csay commands so that say text doesn't have to
       be enclosed in quotes.
     * Another fix to the strbreak() scripting function.
     * Fixed docpath and Specify() bugs in Win32 installer.
     * Do not run plugin_info() for a kicked player.
     * Fixed bug with CS timelimit not working correctly with Linux server.
     * Fixed Linux version of Small compiler to handle DOS files and work when
       no PWD envvar is set.
     * Fixed exploit which would allow players to switch their name to a
       reserved IP and gain access rights associated with that IP.
     * Fixed free/reserved slot reporting to be more robust. 
     * Fixed exploit in plugin_antiflood.
     * Have "" be accepted as "undefined" in adminmod.cfg for all file and
       string cvars.
     * Fixed reject and kick messages to work with old and new clients.


    Coding:

     * VerifyUserAuth() gets called in any case in AddUserAuth(), no matter if
       mapchange, reconnect or new connet.
     * INFO_KEYVAL_SIZE replaces BUF_SIZE for get_/set_serverinfo().
     * Removed HAS_SNPRINTF macros. Everybody has snprintf().
     * Changed the semnatics of auth_struct::head() to return the *current*
       head. Get the next head position with get_head() instead.
     * Changed IsComment() to is_comment(). Overloaded to check for // instead
       for /.
     * Added various utility functions to check and get a cvar value for cvars
       holding string values or filenames/paths: cvar_string_value_is_set(),
       cvar_string_is_set(), cvar_file_value_is_set(), cvar_file_is_set()
       get_cvar_string_value(), get_cvar_file_value(). 
     * Added filesystem node abstraction AmFSNode and AmDir.




15.07.2003 2.50.56

    Changes/Additions:
     * Many xxxsay commands can now wrap too long lines on the fly to prevent
       clients from crashing.
     * Made fade-in time for centersay half the display time.
     * Added scripting function centersayex() which prints centersay() text to
       only one user exclusively.
     * Updated Small language version to 1.8.4.
     * Added MD5 hashes as an encryption method for passwords.
     * New semantic for the encrypt_passwords CVAR, it now takes four possible
       values:
         0: no encryption
         1: encrypt using Unix crypt()
         2: encrypt using MD5 hashes
         3: encrypt using MySQL PASSWORD() (MySQL version only)
       The crypt() and MD5 encryption are available in both Linux and Windows
       versions, the MySQL PASSWORD() method is only available in the MySQL
       version of Admin Mod.
     * The mysql_usePASSWORD cvar was obsoleted by the new encrypt_password
       settings and has been removed.
     * Admin Mod can now convert script binaries between Windows and Linux
       format on the fly during loading. 
     * Changed admin_password command to admin_login command.
     * Made diagnostic output displayed to the admin while connecting more
       verbose to make the login process more transparent to the user.
     * Added parameter to get_userIP() scripting function which can be used to
       get the client port returned.
     * Added support for DoD Retail and Steam clients. Admin Mod does now
       support Valve and Steam Ids. Both the new and the old Valve/Steam Id
       formats are supported. Valve/Steam Ids are added to the users.ini file
       without escaping the colons.
     * Added ADMINMOD_VERSION #define to admin.inc include file. It can be used
       to check for the AM version of the include files in scripts.
     * Updated Windows installer to work with DoD Retail installations.
     * If Admin Mod cannot find the admin_plugins_file CVAR defined it will
       attempt to load the adminmod.cfg file from the addons/adminmod/config
       directory.
     * Removed client say "I'm free, I'm free" from admin_unbury command.


    New CVARS:

     * mysql_database: (default "") This cvar can be used to preselect the
       database that Admin Mod should connect to instead of specifying it in
       the mysql_dbtable_* cvars. So instead of using
         mysql_dbtable_users "amdb.users"
         mysql_dbtable_words "amdb.words"
       one can choose to use
         mysql_database "amdb"
         mysql_dbtable_users "users"
         mysql_dbtable_words "words"


    Bug Fixes:
    
     * Fixed a bug where the installer would choose to install a new line
       in liblist.gam instead of activating an existant inactive one.
     * Disabled port comparison for authenticating reconnecting users since the
       port may change due to NATed connections. On LANs the port is still
       checked.
     * Fixed a bug in MySQL PASSWORD encryption, causing Admin Mod losing snyc
       with the database server under certain circumstances.
     * Fixed bug in admin_ban, preventing it from banning by IP correctly.
     * Added workaround for broken kick command in 3111 server versions.
     * Fixed strbreak() scripting function.
     * Fixed numerous small bugs in the Windows installer.
     * Fixed a few minor bugs in the Linux installer. Better handling when run 
       under Bash version 1.
     * Fixed potential buffer overflow due to wrong snprintf() usage.
     * Fixed reject message to get properly displayed in the message box of DoD
       Retail and Steam clients.
     * Fixed ban() function to work with DoD Retail servers.


    Tools:

     * amxconvert: Added support for AMX file version 5 (from 1.8.4).
     * encrypt: Added a new commandline tool "encrypt" to encrypt passwords
       with either Unix crypt() or MD5.


    Coding:
     * Moved some functins to amutil.cpp from util.cpp
     * Added wrap_line() function, checking line length and being able to wrap
       long lines. 
     * GET_AMX_STRING() has a new parameter to en-/disable line length checks.
     * Converted the Auth backup array into a ringbuffer.
     * Removed bfixed.cpp. The AMX dll includes fixed.c.
     * A new library was created in commonlib. This library contains code
       shared between the AM dll and the utilities or between utilities. The
       encryption and getopt code has been moved into the library.
     * AM_ClientUserInfoChaged() has an additional parameter: bool bForce. If
       set, it will force a check on a player even if his userinfo did not
       change. It will also force a disconnect on a client if he cannot be
       kicked by userid.
     * Makefile: changed default target to MM target. Removed special MMOBJ and
       MMOBJDIR. They get set dynamically now. Fixed target "depend".
     * Added macro for copyright year in resource.h.




21.03.2003:  2.50.52

    Changes/Additions:

     * Added bBanBoth option to ban() function which will ban both ID and
       IP when provided with a name or ID.
     * Added sm_reg as registered command for exec()
     * Moved client_exec notice to post function to get it displayed last.
     * Removed 'unbindall' from allowed execlient() commands.
     * Added default value (0) for amv_private_server
     * Changed sqlPASSWORD to me OFF by default
     * Changed say() message in admin_slayteam to say "Team xy was struck 
       down..." instead of a player name. Could also be changed to list all 
       players on that team, but that may flood the clients.
     * Made the meta-interface mismatch message an INFO message and
       more precise.
    

    Bug Fixes:

     * Fixed exploit: LogPrintf() was used with a supplied string as format
       string, allowing a format exploit.
     * Fixed client exploit: We do now replace non-printable characters with
       '.' for admin commands and strings sent to a client via ClientPrint(). 
       This is in order to screw hack code. Still not a safe solution against 
       this exploit but that can only be implememted on a client. It has 
       nothing to do with Admin Mod.
     * Fixed not being able to use Steamids in the password column in 
       users.ini, which is necessary to link a name to a Steamid.
     * Stop server from crashing when running a timer without the timer 
       entity being present.
     * Stop plugins killing another plugin's timer.
     * Fixed bug in filesize() where a line was counted multiple times 
       when it was longer than BUF_SIZE.
     * Fixed bug in writefile() messing up EOLs under Win32. 
     * Fixed a bug crashing a server when the mySQL PASSWORD() returned 
       a NULL pointer.
     * Fixed typo in CVar name which prevented mySQL PASSWORD() encryption
       from working.
     * Fixed bug loading AMX DLL from Win32 network drive.
     * Fixed a bug in admin authentication code.
     * Linux installer: Fixed bug not detecting MM version when it had no
       patch number. Fixed problems with Bash under FreeBSD. Tries to 
       remember the server directories it has already installed to.


    Tools:

     * amxconvert: CLI: quit if both -u and -w are used.
     * amxconvert: Added Windows CLI version. 


    Coding:    

     * Compiled with HL SDK 2.3.
     * Makefile: Added targets 'sql', 'opt' and 'sqlopt' for more comfort.
     * Extended get_option_cvar_value() to return default values;
     * Changed to link mySQL client library dynamically. Changed to link 
       libstdc++ statically.
     * Corrected MSVC macro since V7 seems to have fixed the double type
       problem. Changed some preprocessor macros to make it compile under
       MSVC++7.       
     * Added Version.mk file which keeps the version number. It gets 
       included from the Makefile.




21.10.2002: 2.50.50

    Changes/Additions:
    
     * Added customized libc functions for efficiency.
     * New scripting functions: get_userFrags(), get_userHealth(),
       get_userTeam(), get_userArmor().
     * Added the option to use an IP in the users.ini file to grant
       access rights by IP.
     * Script functions called from plugin_init() or as the result of a
       vote will be called with access rights of the server console.
     * Changed DLL/DSO loading mechanism. The amx_admin.dll/.so will be
       loaded from the same location as the admin_MM DLL/DSO and can thus
       be moved out of the /dlls directory, too.
     * mySQL: Changed name of mySQL version DLL to admin_MM_mysql.dll.
     * mySQL: Added possibility to use the mySQL PASSWORD() function to
       encrypt passwords in the users/tags/models table. To switch from
       crypt() to PASSWORD() encryption, set mysql_use_sqlPASSWORD to 1.
     * Added Steamid support. See Note about mySQL usage below.
     * Changed to static linkage with libstdc++.
     * Changed team lookup. Spectators will now be reported to be in team
       TEAM_SPECTATOR and HLTV proxies will be reported to be in team
       TEAM_PROXY.
     * Added (BETA!) functionality to check for missing/broken entities.
       This is not a problem of Admin Mod but we may still be able to
       gather information for VALVe. Adding "melog1" to amv_beta_enable
       will switch on checking and logging of broken entities. Adding
       "mefix1" will attempt to fix them. A fix can also be triggered
       from during the game by using "admin_adm mefix".
     * Added a warning in the log when a plugin cannot register all of
       its native functions.
     * A vote no longer accounts for bots when admin_bot_protection is
       on.
     * Match a player not only by IP but also by port when
       re-authenticating him.
     * Better debug info for checking lost permissions on mapchange
       (hopefully).
     * Corrections made to make nextmap() more accurate. Works only when
       maps are changed with admin_ commands.
     * Changed player lookup in order to prevent exploits where players
       use the wonid of an admin as their name. Numbers to admin_commands
       can be escaped with a backslahs to prevent them from being
       interpreted as a name.
     * Added console message to clients when connecting to a server with
       allow_client_exec enabled.
     * Made leading underscore compulsory for password_field values

       
    Bug Fixes:
    
     * Fixed a bug kicking players with ';' in their nicks.
     * Username length set to match engine limit of 33 chars.
     * Fixed security hole in exec() scripting function. It does not
       allow unquoted semicolons anymore, nor the use of 'admin_command'.
       The following exception applies: strings starting with "logd_reg"
       or "sm_register" are allowed to contain "admin_command". This is
       to allow registering commands for LogD and StatsMe to work.
       Additional commands can be added for other third party MM plugins
       with the amv_register_cmds CVAR.
     * Fixed a bug in the AM timer code.
     * Fixed a bug causing player nicks starting with a number to be
       mistaken for a sessionid or wonid.
     * Obsolete CVAR password_timeout removed.
     * Fixed a bug that prevented the use of empty passwords in
       users.ini.
     * Fixed a bug in player lookup function.
     * Fixed a bug counting connected players incorrectly and thus
       filling reserved slots.
     * Fixed playerinfo() function writing to default values of optional
       parameters.
     * Changed users.ini parsing function not to bail out if a line with
       an entry ends with an comment.
     * Fixed "Unknown command" message when executing a command without
       proper access permissions.
     * Fixed a memory leak in the Small AMX which would result in
       heap-stack collisions.
     * Fixed get_userorigin() to not print debug messages to the client.
     * Fixed that the Highlander was not reevaluted when the current
       Highlander left the server.
     * admin_reload did not have an immediate effect on connected player
       access rights.
     * Removed stray line-endings from commands passed to plugins.

       
    New CVARS:
    
     * amv_log_passwords: (0/1, def:0) If set to 0, passwords will not be
       logged in cleartext by debug messages.
     * amv_register_cmds: Space separated list of registering commands
       similar to "logd_reg" of LogD and "sm_register" of StatsMe to
       allow the use of "admin_command" with the exec() scripting
       function.
     * mySQL: mysql_use_sqlPASSWORD: (0/1, def:0) If set, passwords will
       be encrypted with the mySQL PASSWORD() function.
     * amv_vote_duration: (def:30) Controls how long a voting session
       takes.
     * amv_enable_beta: to enable various beta options disabled by
       default.
       



30.01.2002:  2.50.26

    Changes/Additions:

      * Changed authentication checks: if the "username" field from the
        users.ini is a valid integer it ONLY allows for WONID checks (to stop
        players    having their name the same as a valid wonid and stealing 
        the password).  
      * Added linkage between reserved nickname and WONID. When a nickname
        gets reserved with rights -16384 in users.ini and the password is
        the WONID then only this WONID can use the nickname. The password
        provided by the client is not checked.  
      * Converted directmessage() function to print to the chat area. This
        corrects the spamming changes to be visible to clients without
        having to be in the console.  
      * Changed command line parsing to    preserve quotes.
      * Added the Directmessage function to send messages to clients who
        are connecting and cannot be looked up normally.
      * admin_ban will ban by IP if sv_lan is set to 1.  
      * Added execclient_all() function.  
      * Added admin_dmesg() command 
      * ban() now takes three parameters. It is possible to ban by IP or ID.
      * Switched from an allow-list to a deny-list for exec_client().
      * Removed checks for spectator and proxy since this was fixed in an 
        update from Valve.  
      * Added private server mode where only users authenticaed users can
        join.
      * Added code to help with Admin's getting dropped at map change.

      * plugin_CS.sma: Disabled name changes for dead players.  
      * Added a parameter to changelevel() which will send the client to the
        intermission x seconds before the map is changed.
      * Moved the ChangeMap() function to adminlib.inc since it gets used by 
        the dll currently. This way every plugin including adminlib.inc can   
        use the    changelevel() function.   
      * Disable ability for players to change names when dead. Now changes   
        names back for them.  
      * Moved admin_dmesg from plugin_message.sma to plugin_base.sma 
      * plugin_CS.sma: Disable "showbriefing" when restrictions are enabled.  
      * Added admin_banip 



    Bug Fixes:

      * Updated prototype declaration of auth() in admin.inc to correct 
        default value.  
      * Fixed bug causing writeip not getting executed in ban().
      * Fixed banning by IP in ban(). It did not call banip with the time
        which made banip fail.  
      * Fixed Csay, it now >= tests line lengths. Messages of exactly 80
        chars will not be allowed rather then simply not working.
      * Fixed crashes when clients connected.
      * Fixed bugs in reserved slot hiding.
      * Fixed bug in mysql_tags_sql. 
      * Fixes password comparison for nickname checks.
      * Fixes bot protection never getting turned on correctly as it was bound
        to reserve_slots, not to admin_bot_protection.  
      * Fixed checking for regex reserved names. 
      * The configurable reconnect time frame for different slot connections
        still used the fixed value and not the CVar value.  

      * Fix HandleSay style functions that would not work when there were
        quotes surrounding the messages from clients.  



    New CVARS:

      * amv_private_server and amv_prvt_kick_message: When amv_private_server
        is set to one, only users listed in users.ini or users table can
        connect to the server.      



    Coding:

      * Instead of reregistering the TestMsg the ClientPrint() functions now
        use GET_USER_MSG_ID() to get the id from MM into g_msgTextMsg.  
      * Added g_msgTextMsg declaration.
      * Change use of AM_VERSION to RC_VERSION to make it compile.  
      * Added check for invalid index in get_player_edict() 
      * Added setrc.sh script which sets the version number from the Makefile
        in resource.h. resource.h provides the version number to adminmod.rc
        and extdll.h so that it is correct in the file information as well as
        in the admin_version command.  
      * mysql_preload 0 lookup escapes ' in queries 
      * Added escape_chars() function to escape characters in a string.
      * Added pointer to player edict to auth_struct. Added
        get_player_edict() function to access this pointer with server index,
        session id or won id.  
      * Added user_ip()    function to get a users IP with which he connected.  
      * Replaced further SQL query buffer size definitions with 
        QUERY_BUF_SIZE (500).
      * IsNameReserved will now    clear the user struct at the beginning.
      * IsIPValid() makes sure     that the IP has three periods in it.
      * Replaced UTIL_ClientPrintAll() with a version that loops over all 
        player slots and calls ClientPrint().
      * Added overloaded versions of ClientCheck()
      * Added ClientPrintf() and ClientCommand() functions to override the
        respective engine functions. These do bot checking and then call the
        engine functions.  
      * GetUserRecord() can be called with a NULL pointer for the user record
        This can be used for checking for existance. No user record is
        returned.




24.10.2001:  2.50.09

    Changes/Additions:

      * Removed amv_autoban, replaced it with amv_anti_cheat_options.
      * Added BillDoor's suggestion against the    TFC spectator cheat.  
      * Increased line buffer size to LARGE_BUF_SIZE for readfile() and
        writefile() 
      * Using sv_visiblemaxplayers to hide reserved slots from normal
        players.  
      * Added a time window which allows for users to reconnect into a
        different slot. (For CS dropping problems).
      * Remove client passwords from clients to prevent password stealing.

      * Set mp_timelimit to 2 instead of 1 on mapchanges.



   Bug Fixes:

      * Fixed the bug reporting the wrong slots    number on reserve_type 1
      * Fixed bug in reserved slot counts for reserve_type 2.
      * Prevent sending messages to proxies and spectators, needed due to a bug
        in the HTLV code. 

      * Changed admin_ban and admin_kick to not use players name for immunity
        lookup.  



   New CVARS:

      * amv_reconnect_time: Admins can set this to enable the reconnect 
        without reauthing again. The value is the time windows during which
        an admin can reconnect joining into a different slot and still be
        authed. Max is 90.  



    Tools:

      * Added .amx converter tool to convert compiles Small scripts between
        Linux and Windows format.  Written with Qt for cross-platform GUI. 
        A Windows GUI and a Linux CLI version are available.



    Coding:

      * mp.dsp: 
        Include paths are now global options for all configurations. 
        Change them only at the global level.  



18.06.2001:  2.50e

    Changes/Additions:

      * Enabled    playerinfo with bots again.  
      * Added some AHL and SI commands to client_exec list. 
      * Added mysql tag to the version info.
      * Added system error reports to CPlugin::LoadFile() function.
      * Added the plugin_exec() function to call commands from other plugins.  
      * Moved ACCESS_EXECCLIENT to 65536. 

      * Updated plugin_messagemode to use the plugin_exec() function on      
        admin_ commands
      * Redid the mp_timelimit storing to make it more efficient. 



    Bug Fixes:

      * Fixed a bug in the bad name detection. make_friendly replaces %
        now with spaces instead of deleting them.   
      * Fixed a bug in the logging functions of centersay et al which
        messed up the formatting.
      * Fixed the bot_protection in teleport() not showing special fx.
      * Fixed a bug in the timer, checking against MAX_PLAXERS instead of
        NUM_TIMERS 
      * Added checks after each player index lookup to protect against
        referencing NULL pointers. This also fixes a bug crashing the server
        in playerinfo() when cycling through player indices.
 
      * Updated plugin_bat and plugin_all.bat to work with Win95 and WinNT. 



    Coding:

      * Makefile: 
        Added build option to configure opt or debug build at top 
        Moved version number definition to Makefile.
        Made mysql defining easier with only one SQL define.  
      * amx.h:
        Added #pragma pack() at the end to switch off that disturbing pragma
        when it is not needed any longer.  
      * Moved IsPlayerValid() from util.cpp to extdll.h to make it inline.



09.06.2001:  2.50d

    Changes/Additions:

      * writefile() now creates a new file also if it isn't called with the
        append parameter (-1).  
      * admin_connect_msg and admin_repeat_msg can be turned off by setting
        them to "0". The repeat frequency is set with    the cvar
        admin_repeat_freq. Minium value is 15 seconds.  
      * Check for player names with non-printable characters which would crash
        other clients. They are denied access. If they change name in
        mid-game, their HL is closed on the client machine and a 24h ban
        issued depending on the setting of amv_autoban.
      * tsay(), centersay() and rainbow() messages get logged in the logs
        with newlines replaced with "\n" strings.

      * Added KillGlow() command to stop glowing when admin_fun is turned
        off.



    Bug Fixes:

      * Added more bot protections if admin_bot_protection is on. It
        should work now also if admin_fx is turned on.



    New CVARS:

      * amv_autoban: If set to 1 a player that tries to crash the server with
        non-printable characters is banned for 24h.
      * admin_repeat_freq controls the frequency of admin_repeat_msg.



     Coding:

      * Updated MSVC info to include build configuration and version
        resources for MySQL and MM-MySQL versions. The makefile expects
        the MySQL include files in ..\..\MySQL which is under the
        Sourcecode directory. Libraries are in ..\..\MySQL\opt.  
      * Debug messages now use the DEBUG_LOG macro
      * amutil.h gets used now. DEBUG_LOG and DEVEL_LOG have been moved into
        it. It declares pointers to directly used cvars. Some cvars get 
        accessed directly, saving a string comparison. They get registered
        and linked in h_export::GiveFnptToDll(). Global pointers are defined
        in admin_mod.cpp.  
      * statics.cpp, statics.h, sutils.cpp:
        Added files for string tables    and lookup functions.
      * Moved debug message for DispatchObjectCollsionBox() to level 3.
      * Moved timer bebug messages to admin_debug level 2. 
      * Added util function UTIL_LogPrintfFNL(). It will print to the log but
        replace newlines within the string with \n or, if the string is too 
        long for that, with a space.  



01.06.2003:  2.50c

    Changes/Additions:

      * Provides dll version information under Windows.  
      * Added slay() function which is independant from allow_client_exec
      * Log string size has been increased to LARGE_BUF_SIZE.
      * Removed ' * ' from the list of comment characters

      * admin_map and admin_map_vote restore the mp_timelimit after a map
        change even if it isn't set in the server.cfg file.  



    Bug Fixes:

      * Modified teleport to work with bots even if admin_fx is turned on.
      * Fixed a memory leak in AM items list code.
      * Redone the vote_multiple fix to prevent buffor overflows.
      * Added declaration of rainbow() to admin.inc.
      * Fixed the crashes of pointto() and gettarget() under Linux.
      * Fixed a bug of registered commands not showing up in admin_help.
      * Fixed getteamcount().  
      * Added a few clean initializations and security checks in 
        AM_ClientConnect().  
      * Fixed one bug writing beyond a buffer in AM_ClientConnect().  
      * Fixed voting so that certain implementations of snprintf() don't
        cause only the last item to show. Also added in code for setting
        the maximum valid choice in a vote. 
      * Votes for invalid numbers (eg, 5 when    there are only 2 choices) 
        are ignored. admin_vote_echo can be used to echo the votes. 
      * Fixed a bug crashing the server when certain commands were executed
        from the console.
      * Removed linefeeds that had gotten themselves put in the middle of
        strings.
      * The wrong time bug in ban() has been fixed.
      * Hide the timer entity. This removed the crashes in TFC.
      * Added MySQL patch from Jon Paul Nollmann (jpnollmann@adace.com),
        should make MySQL queries more robust 
      * Bug in the tallying of votes that would leave the last option with
        any votes the winner fixed.

      * The say_command override respects admin_quiet 1.
      * Fixed maxextend bug (admin_vote_maxextend <= 0 was not disabling
        extend vote as promised)  
      * admin_slay now honors    admin_quiet.
      * admin_vsay now respects vote_allowed. 
      * admin_balance was still using    'admin_tfc_balance', when the cvar 
        was renamed to 'admin_balance_teams'. 



    Tools:

      * make_pass: Updated version because the username isn't needed anymore 



    Coding:

      * Used const_casts where necessary in order to use the standard 
        STRING macro from the SDK instead of redefining it non-const.
      * Moved two local variables into their #ifndef USE_METAMOD
        environment.  Supresses a warning about unused variables.  
      * Moved metamod directory up one, out of module directory.
      * Removed linkfunc.cpp from MM builds.  
      * CLinkList.cpp, CLinkList.h:
        Moved Constructors and Destructors into class declaration in the
        header file since MSCV didn't like it.  
      * CLinkList.cpp, CLinkList: Hope to have fixed a major memory leak.
        The LinkItem uses a void* pointer to reference its data, but on
        destruction that won't call the destructors of an object pointing
        to. Rewrote the CLinkItem and CLinkList classes as templates.
        Fixed a new char[] and delete inconsistency with the new
        template classes.  
      * Added amutil.h: Adminmod utilities 
      * Added DEVEL_LOG macro to be used to output _lots_ of information
        (depending on the level used) when +developer is set. This is an
        extension to DEBUG_LOG for use during development or to debug
        the really hard bugs.  
      * Updated plugin_* functions to use AMX macros.  Should be a tad bit
        more informative if, for instance, help exceeds the length limit.
      * Added GetMaxVoteChoice, so that admin_mod.cpp could ignore votes
        for invalid items. 
      * Made linkfunc.cpp a target only for non-MM version. 
      * Added in g_fInitialize check to ClientUserInfoChanged.
